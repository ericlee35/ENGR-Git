                        <p>In Project 3, I learned a bunch of new skills like soldering, laser cutting, and iterative design to create a robot car and chassis enclosure. This project was a very cool experience combining previously learned techniques like 3D printing with the Prusa MINIs, expanding on familiar techniques like CAD in Fusion, and gaining exposure to new tools like LightBurn and electronics soldering.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Assembling Our Robots</h2>
                        <p>In the first part of this project, Ava and I assembled our robot from the D2-5 Intelligent Tracking Car DIY kit and followed <a href="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1lEYFXJO1L.pdf">these build instructions.</a> From a first read-through of the instruction manual, a major weakness was a lack of zoomed-in pictures to clearly indicate which parts to use. For example, the resistors looked very similar from afar and it required a really close zoom-in on the instructions to get a better sense of which parts to use, and even then it was a little ambiguous at times. Another tricky part of the instruction manual was inserting the correct negative or positive poles of the capacitors into the circuit board, but the square vs. circular pads helped clarify which end went where. One step that was particularly frustrating was adding the yellow gaskets to the bottom side of the car. I found it helpful to install the wheel and axle pieces and use them to further push the gaskets into the screws. Another confusing step was how the coloration of the wires didn’t match those listed in the instructions. But, after some clarification from Professor Ben, I learned that what really mattered was that each individual wire was positioned in the correct place. Overall, I think the instructions were fairly clear and easy to follow.</p>
                        <p>In terms of the assembly process, it was a very fun experience learning how to solder. We first practiced soldering on an empty circuit board to get a feel for how long to hold the solder near the iron to get the ideal temperature and flow for a “Hershey’s Kiss” solder. We split up the build process by doing half of the work for each step. For example, in Step 1, I would position and solder two resistors and Ava would do the corresponding two resistors. This was a helpful strategy as it allowed us to double-check our work to make sure we were putting the right pieces in the right places with the right directionality.</p>

                        <p>Some notable steps that were a little more difficult were adding the photoresistors and LED lights since they required a specific height away from the circuit board. This step required the use of the stand with the clips to hold the car up in the air. Additionally, when we were working with the wires, the wire strippers would sometimes clip through the casing and the wires, and sometimes the wire would rip off from where it was soldered so this step had to be done a couple of times throughout the project.</p>

                        <p>When we were finished assembling the car, we got to testing it! Surprisingly, it turned on! When I set it down on the track for the first time, it had some difficulty making turns in the left direction, so I screwed in the potentiometers to adjust the sensitivity to the line detection. After adjusting the potentiometers, I was able to get the car moving and making turns. It was cool seeing how the car would make very frequent left and right adjustments, switching movement from one wheel to another to go along the track.</p>

                        <p>Once the car was functioning, we took many many measurements using digital calipers for the car’s exterior, the dimensions of critical parts like the wheels, power button, and LED lights for the next part of this project.</p>

                        <h2>3D Printing</h2>
                        <p>In the next part of this project, we worked on 3D printing designs for our car chassis. For our first iteration, we created a simple box in Fusion. Following along with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDJ2g19SlCI&ab_channel=Mantis3DPrinter">this tutorial</a> on YouTube was really helpful in reviewing the tools in Fusion like the organization of our components and sketches, keyboard shortcuts, extruding, and filleting. </p>
                        <p>In our first 3D printing iteration, we added an extra 10mm of clearance from the base dimensions of the box and had the thickness of our walls be 5mm. After printing, the fit of the box was definitely a bit too large, but it was good to know that the thickness of our walls could be thinner than 5mm. As seen in the pictures below, we had too much clearance in both the length and width of the box so it completely went over the car instead of resting on the exposed parts of the circuit board.</p>

                        <span class="caption text-muted">Extra clearance- fit was a little too large</span>
                        
                        <p>Based on our first design which was too big, we adjusted the dimensions of our design for our second 3D print iteration, and made the thickness of our walls 3mm to better fit between the resistors of our car to allow for exposure of the LED lights. We also had to take many additional measurements to allow access to the different features of the car. In addition to the thinning of walls and tapering of the box to allow access to the LED lights, we cut out additional circular holes in our chassis to allow for the wheels to freely move and a rectangular hole in the back face to press the power button. In terms of access to the batteries, we made sure our design could easily be removed and added back on for battery changes. Additionally, since our car chassis only covered the top portion of the car, we didn’t have to worry about blockages to the sensors on the ground.</p>
                        <p>After the second iteration was printed, we placed it on top of the car and found the fit to be really good around the LED lights and the power button. However, our hole cutouts for wheel movement were too close to the back of the car. This mistake most likely occurred because we placed the wheel holes about 14mm from the base of the car. But since we incorporated extra clearance along the length of the car and had to add additional length for the thickness of the print material, the holes did not fully allow exposure to the wheels. So, the car was not able to freely move since the print material was rubbing against the tires. For our next iterations, we fixed this issue by taking measurements of the wheels starting from the front and back of the car to get a better placement of the holes. We also reduced the length of the car by 4mm to allow for a better fit of the chassis.</p>

                        <h2>Laser Cutting</h2>
                        <p>In the next part of this project, we worked on laser cutting- a subtractive manufacturing process. It was definitely a little bit of an adjustment thinking about how to adapt our design from 3D printing (an additive process) and learning how to use new techniques like finger joints and using LightBurn, but it was enjoyable.</p>
                        <p>Our first iteration of our laser cut chassis was based on Fusion tutorials learning how to create a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrcqauNvt0M&ab_channel=WhatMakeArt">finger joint box</a> and <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Parametric-Open-Box-With-Finger-Joints-in-Fusion36/">parameterization of our designs.</a> By following along with these tutorials, I’d say I’ve gained some more comfort using Fusion and its layout of different tools for sketching, altering dimensions, placement of components, and extruding. I learned about the use of new tools like mirroring to duplicate the planes of the box. It was also really cool to learn about the cut tool to cut corresponding fingers to a rectangular plane that is adjacent to two planes that already have joints to them. One difficulty I encountered was sometimes I would have over-constrained sketches when creating rectangles and midpoint lines for the finger joints. The interface could get clustered at times with the symbols for sketch lines that had to be kept perpendicular, equal in dimension, or parallel. So, when I got messages saying my sketch was overconstrained, it would be difficult to diagnose which sketch lines had issues. I’d find myself just undoing my steps and redoing the sketch again which definitely wasn’t the most time-effective strategy but it helped me gain more practice with the process. The tutorial was also helpful in explaining the different tools used and also tasks like combining components and mirroring parts in a step-by-step manner.</p>

                        <p>For our first iteration, we created a simple finger joint box like the one in the tutorial, but with dimensions specific to our car. We then transferred our design from Fusion to LightBurn by saving sketches for each individual plane in our design and exporting them as .dxf files. In LightBurn, we imported these sketches and rearranged them next to each other to save wasted materials during cutting. From there, we downloaded our lightburn files and opened them on the class computer, rearranging them on the template board file and making sure the cut settings were sent to 100% power and about 20% speed so it would cut through the material fully. Luckily, we didn’t have major issues with our cuts and the parts were able to be cut through on the first try. After gluing the pieces together, we got our first iteration. This time, the dimensions of the width and height of the box fit well with the car. However, along the length of the car, the material hit the LED lights, so it couldn’t enclose the car.</p>

                        <p>For our second iteration, we cut out holes for the wheels and power button for a better fit to the car compared to the simple box. We initially intended to cut holes for the LED lights as well, but forgot to add this to our design because we were caught up in some Fusion confusion. We had difficulty moving our component for the wheel holes because our sketch and component organization started getting pretty messy and disorganized. However, we eventually were able to select and move our hole for the car. A good lesson on organization in Fusion.</p>

                        <p>Our second iteration print went well but again, the length of the car chassis hit the LED lights so it couldn’t enclose the car. For our third iteration, we cut out additional holes along the LED lights and used specific measurements with a lot of extra clearance around the lights to make sure our box would fit. In the end, our laser cut was able to allow access to the power button in the back, movement of the wheels and exposure of the LED lights along the sides, easy access to the batteries by removing the chassis, and the sensors could see the ground! If we continued to iterate our design, we would make some of our holes smaller to allow for a better fit of the chassis with the wheels and LED lights and make more cosmetic changes to the box like rounded edges and less boxy sides.</p>

                        <p>I also found the parameterization of the design really helpful. It was really nice being able to adjust parameters once in the parameter settings and having this change apply to multiple parts of the design that used that dimension. It also helped avoid mistakes in typing in the wrong dimension for a part. For example, we increased the width of our box by 3mm for our second laser cut iteration, and it made updating the design very quick and easy.</p>

                        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                        <p>This project gave me good practice with the iterative design process and exposure to lots of new skills for 3D printing, laser cutting, CAD in Fusion, and electronics soldering. I think these skills dealing with the form and fit of a product will be especially helpful in our next couple of projects related to prosthetics.</p>
